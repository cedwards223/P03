This is the README file for Project 3.

The pupose of this code is to decode a Ceaser Cipher.

The main function decodes and prints out the decoded cipher.

Build -- gcc -o readspecial readspecial.c

Execution -- ./readspecial

The most interesting thing I am learning about this project is that

I still do not understand how to correctly dynamically allocate memory for arrays. I do not really understand the syntax of it. Did I do it right?

One of the biggest problems I faced with this project is getting the struct to read in correctly. Still working on it.

What I would like to have known before coming into this project is how to dynamically allocate memory as well as pass a pointer to a struct  to another funcition.
